 * by the next session both the stale retry flag and the now-elapsed due date
 * can be true at once. GrammarSRSService.applyAnswer's retry branch (which
 * `needsRetry` takes priority into) never advances dueDate, so answering it
 * once as a "retry" leaves the point immediately due again as a "fresh"
 * review - a second encounter for what the user experiences as one point.
 *
 * Called once, at session start, only for points whose regular review is ALSO
 * due right now - a fresh scheduled review already re-tests the exact recall
 * the stale retry existed to correct. Deliberately does NOT touch a
 * same-session retry (a wrong answer's dueDate is pushed well past "now", so
 * it can't also read as due until long after the session that set it ended) -
 * only ever called from the session-start effect, never mid-session.
